The Borderlands Community Mod Manager was developed by LightChaosman, with assistance from apocalyptech, Bugworm, c0dycode, and FromDarkHell.

OpenBLCMM is a fully-opensourced version of BLCMM maintained by the BLCMods community (with apocalyptech as the current lead).  Thanks to LightChaosman for opensourcing the BLCMM core!

Special thanks to everyone who's contributed to the development process, and thanks to the entire Borderlands modding community for feedback
