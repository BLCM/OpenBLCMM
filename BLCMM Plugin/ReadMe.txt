This is the basic template project you can use to develop BLCMM plugins, the easiest way yet to automatically process BL2/TPS dump data.
Included is an example plugin and its source code, which shows ways to interact with the BLCMM data library.

To make your plugin ready for BLCMM, use the "clean and build" option in NetBeans.
This will create a .jar file in '<your project folder>/dist/'.
Copy the this .jar file to the 'plugins/' folder of your BLCMM installation.
You do not need to copy the `dist/lib/` folder generated by the clean and build, since they are already part of BLCMM.

To get started with the API provided to interact with the object data present in the game, and the currently opened file in BLCMM, read trough "BLCMM plugin introduction.md".
This is a markdown file. Open it with your favourite markdown editor, or copy its contents to an online one, like `https://stackedit.io/app#`.
