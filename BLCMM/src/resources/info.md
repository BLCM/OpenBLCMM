Provenance of the various resources in here
===========================================

* `donate.png` - This was just taken from a screenshot at paypal.com from
  their set-up-a-donation-link page, with the HTML/CSS fiddled a little
  bit to just say "Donate" and to make the button less wide.  (Then edited
  in Gimp to make the background transparent.)

* `Icon.png` / `openblcmm_icon.xcf` - Currently just a placeholder icon for
  BLCMM.  Constructed by apocalyptech in Gimp in a rather crude fashion.
  I'm hoping to get a much better one in place at some point.

* `Qmark.png` - Free-to-use icon from [Fathema Khanom](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/fathema-khanom)'s
  [User Interface set](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/user-interface-2899), available
  under [Flaticon's Free License](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/ui).
  (Though not with the filename used here.)

* `exec.png` / `padlock.png` / `speaker.png` - - Some icons from
  [Dave Gandy](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/dave-gandy)'s
  [Font Awesome set](http://www.flaticon.com/packs/font-awesome), available under
  CC BY 3.0.  (Though not with the filenames used here.)

* `<gamedir>/GBX_hotfixes.blcm` - BLCM-formatted mod file containing the
  vanilla hotfixes still provided by GBX at time of writing.  This is the
  same version as was present in the original BLCMM versions, since it's
  just the raw data.

* `<gamedir>/vanillaLevelLists.blcm` - BLCM-formatted mod file containing
  the vanilla `LevelList` attributes for all `LevelDependencyList` objects.
  Used by BLCMM for handling map merges.  This is the same version as was
  present in the original BLCMM versions, since it's just the raw data.

* `<gamedir>/Icon.png` - Official game icons, though I'm honestly not sure
  exactly where they originally came from.  These appear to be the official
  icons from the game, and used by Steam, but the highest res I can extract
  from any source of mine is 64x64, whereas the BL2+TPS versions here are
  256x256.
