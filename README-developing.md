Developing OpenBLCMM
--------------------

*(this is gonna be real barebones for awhile)*

OpenBLCMM was developed using NetBeans, most recently with NetBeans IDE 16.

The currently-checked-in project expects a NetBeans Java platform named
"`JDK_19`" -- you can get to that via NetBeans' `Tools -> Java Platforms`.
If you've already got a JDK 19 installed under a different name, you could
try renaming it, or alter the configured Java environment to suit.
Alternatively, you could create a new environment and just point it at
the same directory as your existing Java Environment.

Once the project's been opened up in Netbeans and the `JDK_19` platform is
available, you should be able to just run it via the GUI -- there'll be a
green "Play" icon in the main toolbar, or various menu options.
