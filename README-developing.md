*(this is gonna be real barebones for awhile)*

BLCMM was developed using NetBeans, most recently with NetBeans IDE 16.

The currently-checked-in project expects a NetBeans Java platform named
"`JDK_8`" -- you can get to that via NetBeans' `Tools -> Java Platforms`.
If you've already got JDK 8 installed, it might be showing up there
as `JDK 1.8` or something.  I just created a new environment with the
`JDK_8` name, pointed at the same dir as the already-present `JDK 1.8`.
