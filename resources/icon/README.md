OpenBLCMM app icon, created by Apocalyptech.

This was originally created in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), which really
wasn't the right tool to use for this kind of vectorish-looking art.  So,
shortly prior to official release, I ended up rebuilding it in
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) as an SVG.  Several orders of magnitude
smaller!  The main path could really use some normalization; I think the
arch isn't entirely centered, and each of the corner curves are slightly
different.  Still, it looks Good Enough for now, especially given that
it's generally scaled down to 64x64 or smaller.

`arch_reference.jpg` is the screenshot I used to construct the path,
originally.  That's from BL3, actually -- the arch in BL2 has a pretty
different-looking shape, as it turns out, but I like the look of BL3's
better.

Rendered versions in the github tree:
 - `src/resources/Icon.png` - 256x256, used inside OpenBLCMM itself
 - `windows-processing/openblcmm.ico` - 64x64, used for Windows installer
   and EXE.
