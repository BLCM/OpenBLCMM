OpenBLCMM app icon, created by Apocalyptech.

[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) really isn't the right tool to use for this
kind of vectorish-looking art, but it's what I used anyway.  The `.ggr`
files here are Gimp Gradient files.  The "Darker" variant is what I'm
using on the "final" version of the icon at the moment, in case anyone
wanted to play with it.  The arch and icon outlines are stored as
Paths, so they should be easy to play with.  Rendered version is out
in `src/resources`.
